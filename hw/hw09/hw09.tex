        \question[30] 
        (Stacey 10.1)
        Calculate the average cosine of the scattering angle in the 
        center-of-mass system for neutrons at 
        1MeV, 100keV, and 1keV colliding with uranium, iron, carbon, and hydrogen.

        \question[40] (Stacey 10.2)
        Calculate the values of the average lethargy increase, $\xi$, and the 
        average cosine of the scattering angle in the lab system, $\mu_0$, for 
        the neutron energies and nuclei of Problem 1 (Stacey 10.1), for 
        isotropic scattering and for linearly isotropic scattering.

        \question[30] (Stacey 12.1)
        Use the proton gas model of Eqs. 12.51 to 12.53 and 12.58 to calculate 
        the low-energy neutron flux distribution in water at 300K. Use 
$\delta_s^H = 38$ barns, $\sigma_s^{H_2O}=0.66$ barn, and $\sigma_s^O=4.2$ 
barns.
