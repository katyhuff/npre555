        \question[30] 
        (Stacey 13.1)
        A critical slab reactor has 1m thickness. 
        Use one speed diffusion theory and perturbation theory to 
        determine the reactivity worth of a 0.25\% increase in the fission 
        cross section over the left half of the slab reactor.

        Use the Rayleigh quotient to estimate the effective 
        multiplication constant of a bare cylindrical core with $\frac{H}{D} 
        =1$, $H=2m$, and one speed diffusion theory parameters $D=1.0cm$, 
        $\Sigma_a=0.15cm^{-1}$, and $\nu\Sigma_f=0.16cm^{-1}$.
